# Rainfall_Nowcasting
This repository provides implementation of rainfall nowcasting using LSTM-based models (Stacked, Encoderâ€“Decoder, Autoencoder) with multi-sensor data fusion. Weather station, GNSS, radar, and lightning data are combined to enhance short-term forecasts in tropical coastal regions.
