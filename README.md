# Rainfall_Nowcasting
This repository provides implementation of rainfall nowcasting using LSTM-based models (Stacked, Encoderâ€“Decoder, Autoencoder) with multi-sensor data fusion. Weather station, GNSS, radar, and lightning data are combined to enhance short-term forecasts in tropical coastal regions.
Description:
This repository contains the implementation, data preprocessing workflows, and evaluation scripts for rainfall nowcasting using advanced LSTM-based architectures (Stacked LSTM, Encoderâ€“Decoder LSTM, and Autoencoder LSTM). The study leverages multi-sensor data fusion combining Weather Station (WS), GNSS-derived tropospheric delays, weather radar reflectivity, and lightning observations to improve short-term rainfall forecasts in tropical coastal regions.

Key Features:

ðŸ“Š End-to-end pipeline for rainfall data preprocessing (time series cleaning, scaling, feature engineering).

ðŸ”— Multi-sensor fusion framework integrating GNSS, radar, lightning, and AWS datasets.

ðŸ§  Implementation of three deep learning models:

Stacked LSTM

Encoderâ€“Decoder LSTM

Autoencoder LSTM

âš¡ Evaluation using regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) and event-detection metrics (FAR, CSI, Precision, Recall, F1).

ðŸ“‰ Visualization scripts for loss curves, prediction vs. actual rainfall, and feature contribution analysis.
